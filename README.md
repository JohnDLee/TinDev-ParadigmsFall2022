### To RUN
- Navigate to `root/register/login`

### John's Tasks
- Displaying error messages on signup.
- Login/Connecting Recruiter Profile and Candidate Profile after it's created.

### Mark's Tasks
Create Recruiter Profile
- For now, just create the Form/page where you can create the Recruiter model.
- Inside register I have a Recruiter Profile. It's wrong, but the attribute fields are correct. Move them into the recruiter app 
- Make sure you use bootstrap. I have example in the code I've already written on how to set things up
- Make sure you associate the profile with a specific user id

### Chris's Tasks
Create Candidate Profile
- Same thing as Mark, just create the Form/page, and view where you can initialize a Candidate profile. 
- Move the stuff from register into the candidate app
- Make sure you associate the profile with a specific user id.
