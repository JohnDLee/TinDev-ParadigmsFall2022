### Mark & Chris Tasks
- [] Finish Designing the Post page. I've finished all the functionality with update and delete.
- [] 1.4 (For candidate, Just see how I logout (just a redirect))
- [] 2.5 After implementing Post page, include the interested candidates and ability to make an offer
- [] 2.6 Implement candidate algorithm.
- [] 3.1 Create an equivalent Candidate Homepage. This should not be too bad, considering you can roughly copy my Recruiter Homepage. For changing the view, look at how I filtered it on the Recruiter Homepage
- [] 3.2-3.4 You figure it out. Should be the easy part.
